She/Her
### The Creator
The only reason they haven't burn the entire server down.
### The Character
She's a pacifist, and has also tried to teach pacifism to others and failed (...Milk...), and tries to calm down fights. 

A bit insane from living alone from a long time and sometimes hears noises D: Also horrible memory! Maybe also from spending so much time alone? 

ANIMALS /pos

SHINY /pos

Cares a lot about Milk specifically and enjoyed the period of time where Milk moved in. Built [[3. Lore/Places/Seraph's Haven\|Seraph's Haven]] to act as a retreat for everyone away from the wars. Also paranoid, leading to the construction of the bunker. 

Oddly attached to endermen

Views her Elytra as a extension of her body and is rarely seen without them
