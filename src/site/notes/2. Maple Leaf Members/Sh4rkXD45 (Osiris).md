### The Character:
Was found by [[2. Maple Leaf Members/Th3s1ll13s (Grian Thes Squid)\|Th3s1ll13s (Grian Thes Squid)]] in a forest and dragged back to meet [[2. Maple Leaf Members/Milkway173 (Milk)\|Milkway173 (Milk)]]. Currently lives with Thes and Milk in [[3. Lore/Places/Church of Talionis\|Church of Talionis]]. After meeting Milk, they were threatened with an Axe when showing increasing distress to being told to "stab me in the chest, again, again, do it again". Has a minor breakdown after, and is shown how to craft things by Milk.

In another world long ago, Osiris was a watcher who was created on accident. Xelqua was a watcher who primarily cared for and contained Osiris, who's demeanor was more 'child like' and was unable to fully control his powers. Watchers would release him to destroy worlds they didn't. 

A watcher he blindly trusted name Awake suggested to banish him as he didnt follow rules.  He was meant to die as he was tossed into a unknown world, with out any memories of being a watcher, and became mortal. A mark remains on his neck, where they removed his memories. His wings burned in the fall to Maple Leaf SMP.

Somehow, he still has his powers although he doesn't know that.

He has nightmares of figures in cloaks, and reads about watchers, wanting to be nothing like them despite being one.
