#Members 
### Pronouns 
She/They
### The Creator
Anxiety in a trench coat person who is the definition of insanity, but likes messing with code, science, art, writing, and research rabbit holes.
They have plans to create content, however does not create much at the time due to Life.
### The Character
Intern is the only one who is aware of the fact that the others exist on a Minecraft server, tasked with the unfortunate task of keeping "insane gremlins who try to kill each other"(/pos) alive.

They mainly live in the console, and only appear in physical form to test, troubleshoot, and maintain the world. One day, she wandered the console too far and met another like her, by the name of Annabelle. It was nice to be able to discuss things with another who understood it, and she learned to do cool things with the code.

She posts sometimes onto TikTok. It's a strange place, traversing the world called the Internet.

Their console access may make them seem like 'god' to other characters, however they are *not* in any way god or divine. There are currently no official gods on the server.

Recently has been seen to be sleep deprived and going insane due to how the players behave.
