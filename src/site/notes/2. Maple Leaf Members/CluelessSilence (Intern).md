Anxiety in a trench coat person who is the definition of insanity, but likes messing with code, science, art, writing, and research rabbit holes.
They have plans to create content, however does not create much at the time due to Life.
### The Character
Intern is the only one who is aware of the fact that the others exist on a Minecraft server, tasked with the unfortunate task of keeping "insane gremlins who try to kill each other"(/pos) alive.
They mainly live in the console, and only appear in physical form to test or troubleshoot.   
She posts sometimes onto TikTok at this time.  
Their console access may make them seem like 'god' to other characters, however they are *not* in any way god or divine. There are currently no official gods on the server.
