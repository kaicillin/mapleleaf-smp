#Meta 
This wiki is maintained by Intern (Kaicillin IRL) and exists canonically, however the other characters aren't aware of it as that would break the 4th wall.

I'm organizing this on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which uses markdown, and adding the content with help from everyone else on the server!

I originally tried to host this with GitHub pages and [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), but was unable to figure that out (It seems like a really cool plugin but I did not have the brain power to figure all the trouble shooting out). If it all goes to plan, this page is hosted with the use of the [Digital Gardens Plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) for Obsidian and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Currently using the [Primary](https://primary-theme.github.io/) theme until I figure out how to code a custom theme, submit it to obsidian, and also possibly dynamic background (I have a plugin on obsidian installed, however it does not carry over)

The goal of this Wiki is to keep track of lore and characters on Maple Leaf SMP, as well as any out of canon things of importance.

Oh also, incase you are someone who's from the internet. If this isn't obvious. 

**DO NOT STALK, OR HARASS ANYONE HERE.**

Respect everyone and don't push for information they don't share themselves!
