### Established by
[[2. Maple Leaf Members/DarkWarrior4 (Dark)\|DarkWarrior4 (Dark)]]  
### Info
The Darkpire is a empire created with the goal of a haven for the adults of the server, where the minors on the server wouldn't be be able to cause chaos. Colonies were being setup, but [[2. Maple Leaf Members/Milkway173 (Milk)\|Milkway173 (Milk)]] bombed the Nether base of the Darkpire as well as [[2. Maple Leaf Members/DarkWarrior4 (Dark)\|DarkWarrior4 (Dark)]]'s base.

The land was destroyed via a large amount of TNT, and the empire no longer exists.
