#LoreFreeZone #Places 
Lore free zones were established around Nov. 17. 2024, and officially established after [[2. Maple Leaf Members/Milkway173 (Milk)\|Milkway173 (Milk)]] exploded [[2. Maple Leaf Members/DarkWarrior4 (Dark)\|DarkWarrior4 (Dark)]]'s base.  
They are not currently enforced via plugins/other admin actions.
