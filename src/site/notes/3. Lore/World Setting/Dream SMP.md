The Dream SMP in lore, is considered actual history that happened sometime in the past. References are made to it, such as [[2. Maple Leaf Members/Pyratiosaur (Javs)\|Pyratiosaur (Javs)]] being called a c!Technoblade, or [[2. Maple Leaf Members/RoseTurtle78213 (Leaf)\|RoseTurtle78213 (Leaf)]] being called c!Tommy.

It would be possibly history sometime from the 1700s AD or earlier.

All references in lore to the Dream SMP refer solely to the canonical storylines of the server, and we do not in any way support the creators who have been found out to be bad people.
