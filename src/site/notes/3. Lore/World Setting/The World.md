Other than [[2. Maple Leaf Members/CluelessSilence (Intern)\|CluelessSilence (Intern)]], everyone lives and exists only in the server. They view the Minecraft world as real life.

There is no established canon life system.

There is free travel to the End and the Nether, and the dragon has been slain multiple times.

There are no restrictions on Elytra.
